Node.js Architecture:

Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient.
The architecture consists of:
- Event Loop: Handles asynchronous operations.
- V8 Engine: Executes JavaScript code.
- libuv: Provides cross-platform asynchronous I/O operations.
- Core Modules: Built-in modules like fs, http, etc.
- C++ Addons: Allows interfacing with native libraries.

Advantages of Node.js:
- Non-blocking and asynchronous nature, ideal for I/O intensive applications.
- Lightweight and efficient, suitable for real-time applications.
- Large ecosystem of libraries (npm) and active community support.
